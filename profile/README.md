# Projects

## Branding

[Branding](https://www.notion.so/Branding-3e96af10e0a54a969ff3e303160007f9?pvs=21)

These are the brand guidelines, logos, etc for the Meritite Union brand.

## Meriteji

[Meriteji](https://www.notion.so/Meriteji-563fce0fb1e843d58494be06747cff2e?pvs=21)

This is a conlang built for the Meritite Union universe and its games taking place in the country, the Meritite Union. As such, it is in games like the Town Builder and AquÃ­, but not in Iridescent.

## Sofia Project

[Sofia Project](https://www.notion.so/Sofia-Project-df02236371ac4a17ac0273d2191d41b8?pvs=21)

## AquÃ­

[AquÃ­](https://www.notion.so/Aqu-8cfd61f45c10431d9f32100ad14daa38?pvs=21)

This is a basic, proof of concept aquarium tycoon simulation game built in Godot.

## To Be Named Town Builder

[TBN Town Builder](https://www.notion.so/TBN-Town-Builder-0b13fc5be9a84d599a0bc2d1be64666f?pvs=21)

This town builder game is a smaller scale city simulation game, with a strong focus on neighbor relations and real life problems. The game is built on a duality premise: Animal mayor by day, human regular child by night.

## Iridescent

[Iridescent](https://www.notion.so/Iridescent-529b7af21fac42ec81435cff184c5bb5?pvs=21)

Iridescent is a dream future 3D puzzle game. Its premise is that it takes place in a subatomic abstract world with elementary particles acting together to solve problems. It is independent from the Meritite Union Universe.

## Meritite Union Rail

[MU Rail](https://www.notion.so/MU-Rail-8b18b76e98fa4f6b95f7b65affcf32be?pvs=21)

This is a complete project. I created an idea for an ideal US high speed rail network map. This is the origin of the name Meritite Union, so I thought Iâd include it here though itâs not much.

## Defunct and Abandoned Projects

Anything, etc. (GP)
