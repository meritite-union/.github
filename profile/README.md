# This is the Meritite Union.

And it's a lie. I hope we look like an up-and-coming indie game dev company. But the we is just me. It's a cover for *@hergergy*, Henry Chandler. I'm not a company. I'm a person. And I have no intentions of being successful.

Here, you might find something interesting or maybe even useful, but probably not. I don't think it matters, though. The Meritite Union is experience! It's organized procrastination, so it's not me putting real things back, it's *working*.

If you come back later maybe there'll be something new.
